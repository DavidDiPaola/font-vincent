# vincent
A nice fixed-width 8x8 ASCII font by Quinn Evans

I tend to use this font for many of my low-level projects where a custom character set is required. Many thanks to Quinn Evans, the original author, for creating this great work and also for releasing it into the public domain.

The font is in the following file formats:

  - `vincent.h` -- The original C header format.
  - `vincent.h.xbm` -- Nearly the same as `vincent.h`, but hacked into the XBM format to allow for importing into GIMP.
  - `vincent.png` -- PNG version of the font.
  - `vincent_horiz.h` -- Each glyph is rotated clockwise 90 degrees. Useful for some graphical LCD controllers like the ST7565.
  - `vincent_horiz.png` -- PNG version of vincent_horiz.h.
